	abstract = {EMMA is a cosmological simulation code aimed at investigating the
reionization epoch. It handles simultaneously collisionless and gas
dynamics, as well as radiative transfer physics using a moment-based
description with the M1 approximation. Field quantities are stored and
computed on an adaptive three-dimensional mesh and the spatial
resolution can be dynamically modified based on physically motivated
criteria. Physical processes can be coupled at all spatial and temporal
scales. We also introduce a new and optional approximation to handle
radiation: the light is transported at the resolution of the non-refined
grid and only once the dynamics has been fully updated, whereas
thermo-chemical processes are still tracked on the refined elements.
Such an approximation reduces the overheads induced by the treatment of
radiation physics. A suite of standard tests are presented and passed by
EMMA, providing a validation for its future use in studies of the
reionization epoch. The code is parallel and is able to use graphics
processing units (GPUs) to accelerate hydrodynamics and radiative
transfer calculations. Depending on the optimizations and the compilers
used to generate the CPU reference, global GPU acceleration factors
between ×3.9 and ×16.9 can be obtained. Vectorization and
transfer operations currently prevent better GPU performance and we
expect that future optimizations and hardware evolution will lead to
greater accelerations.},
