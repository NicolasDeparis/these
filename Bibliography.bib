	abstract = {The hierarchical model of galaxy formation is known to suffer from the ``over-cooling'' problem: the high efficiency of radiative cooling results in too much baryonic matter in a condensed phase (namely, cold gas or stars) when compared to observations. A solution proposed by many authors (see Springel \& Hernquist 2003; Fujita et al. 2004; Rasera \& Teyssier 2005) is feedback due to supernova (SN) driven winds or active galactic nuclei. Modeling SN feedback by direct injection of thermal energy usually turns out to be inefficient in galaxy-scale simulations, due to the quasi-instantaneous radiation of the SN energy. To avoid this effect, we have developed a new method to incorporate SN feedback in cosmological simulations: using temporary test particles, we reproduce explicitly a local Sedov blast wave solution in the gas distribution. We have performed several self-consistent runs of isolated Navarro, Frenk, \& White (1996, hereafter NFW) halos with radiative cooling, star formation, SN feedback and metal enrichment using the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES (Teyssier 2002). We have explored the influence of SN feedback on the formation and the evolution of galaxies with different masses. We have studied the efficiency of the resulting galactic winds, as a function of the mass of the parent halo.},

numerical astrophysics. They are becoming crucial for an increasing
number of astrophysical and cosmological problems; at the same time
their computational cost has come within reach of currently available
computational power. Further progress is retarded by the considerable
number of different algorithms (including various flavours of ray
tracing and moment schemes) developed, which makes the selection of the
most suitable technique for a given problem a non-trivial task.
Assessing the validity ranges, accuracy and performances of these
schemes is the main aim of this paper, for which we have compared 11
independent RT codes on five test problems: (0) basic physics; (1)
isothermal HII region expansion; (2) HII region expansion with evolving
temperature; (3) I-front trapping and shadowing by a dense clump and (4)
multiple sources in a cosmological density field. The outputs of these
tests have been compared and differences analysed. The agreement between
the various codes is satisfactory although not perfect. The main source
of discrepancy appears to reside in the multifrequency treatment
approach, resulting in different thicknesses of the ionized-neutral
transition regions and the temperature structure. The present results
and tests represent the most complete benchmark available for the
development of new codes and improvement of existing ones. To further

A possible solution of this problem involves stellar feedback. A strong baryonic wind driven by vigorous star formation can remove a large fraction of the gas, causing the dark matter to expand. Using both numerical and analytical techniques, we explore the maximum effect of the feedback with an instantaneous removal of the gaseous disc. The energy input depends on the compactness of the disc, hence the specific angular momentum of the disc. For the plausible cosmological parameters and a wide range of the disc angular momenta, the feedback is
insufficient to destroy the central halo cusp, while the inner density is lowered only by a modest factor of 2 to 6. Any realistic modelling of the feedback would have even lesser impact on dark matter. We find that no star formation effect can resolve the problems of CDM cusps.},

simulations that resolve formation of cluster galaxies. The simulations of nine individual clusters spanning a decade in mass are performed with the shock-capturing Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement
N-body+gasdynamical Adaptive Refinement Tree code. For each cluster the simulations were done in the adiabatic regime (without dissipation) and with radiative cooling and several physical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation: star formation, metal enrichment, and stellar feedback. We show that radiative cooling of gas and
associated star formation increase the total baryon fractions within radii as large as the virial radius. The effect is strongest within cluster cores, where the simulations with cooling have baryon fractions larger than the universal value, in contrast to the adiabatic
simulations in which the fraction of baryons is substantially smaller than the universal value. At larger radii (r{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}r500) the cumulative baryon fractions in simulations with cooling are close to the universal value. The gas fractions in simulations with dissipation are reduced by {\textasciitilde}20\%-40\% at r{\textless}0.3rvir and {\textasciitilde}10\% at larger radii compared to the adiabatic runs, because a fraction of gas is converted into stars. There is an indication that gas fractions within different radii increase with increasing cluster mass as
fgas{\textasciitilde}M0.2vir. We find that the total baryon fraction within the cluster virial radius does not evolve with time in both adiabatic simulations and in simulations with cooling. The gas fractions in the latter decrease slightly from z=1 to 0 due to ongoing star formation. Finally, to evaluate systematic uncertainties in the baryon fraction in cosmological simulations we present a comparison of gas fractions in our adiabatic simulations to resimulations of the same objects with the entropy-conserving smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Gadget. The cumulative gas fraction profiles in the two sets of simulations on average agree to better than {\textasciitilde}3\% outside the cluster core (r/rvir{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.2) but differ by up to 10\% at small radii. The differences are smaller than those found in previous comparisons of Eulerian and SPH simulations. Nevertheless, they are systematic and have to be kept in mind when using gas fractions from cosmological
simulations.},

code that perturbations arising from discretization of the equations of
self-gravitational hydrodynamics can grow into fragments in
multiple-grid simulations, a process we term ``artificial
fragmentation.'' We present star formation calculations of isothermal
collapse of dense molecular cloud cores. In simulation of a
Gaussian-profile cloud free of applied perturbations, we find artificial
fragmentation can be avoided across the isothermal density regime by
ensuring the ratio of cell size to Jeans length, which we call the Jeans
number, J ≡ Δx/λJ , is kept below 0.25. We
refer to the constraint that λJ be resolved as the
Jeans condition. When an m = 2 perturbation is included, we again find
it necessary to keep J {\textless}= 0.25 to achieve a converged morphology.
Collapse to a filamentary singularity occurs without fragmentation of
the filament, in agreement with the predictions of Inutsuka \&
Miyama. Simulation beyond the time of this singularity requires an
arresting agent to slow the runaway density growth. Physically, the
breakdown of isothermality due to the buildup of opacity acts as this
agent, but many published calculations have instead used artificial
viscosity for this purpose. Because artificial viscosity is resolution
dependent, such calculations produce resolution-dependent results. In
the context of the perturbed Gaussian cloud, we show that use of
artificial viscosity to arrest collapse results in significant violation
of the Jeans condition. We also show that if the applied perturbation is
removed from such a calculation, numerical fluctuations grow to produce
substantial fragments not unlike those found when the perturbation is
included. These findings indicate that calculations that employ
artificial viscosity to halt collapse are susceptible to contamination
by artificial fragmentation. The Jeans condition has important
implications for numerical studies of isothermal self-gravitational
hydrodynamics problems insofar as it is a necessary but not, in general,
sufficient condition for convergence.},

description with the M1 approximation. Field quantities are stored and
computed on an adaptive three-dimensional mesh and the spatial
resolution can be dynamically modified based on physically motivated
criteria. Physical processes can be coupled at all spatial and temporal
scales. We also introduce a new and optional approximation to handle
radiation: the light is transported at the resolution of the non-refined
grid and only once the dynamics has been fully updated, whereas
thermo-chemical processes are still tracked on the refined elements.
Such an approximation reduces the overheads induced by the treatment of
radiation physics. A suite of standard tests are presented and passed by
EMMA, providing a validation for its future use in studies of the
reionization epoch. The code is parallel and is able to use graphics
processing units (GPUs) to accelerate hydrodynamics and radiative
transfer calculations. Depending on the optimizations and the compilers
used to generate the CPU reference, global GPU acceleration factors
between ×3.9 and ×16.9 can be obtained. Vectorization and

computing gravitational forces. Our tests are relevant to the evolution
of non-linear structure in hierarchically clustering universes. In
particular, we study the collapse and merger of quasi-spherical, slowly
rotating clumps containing a mixture of gas and collisionless dark
matter. For self-similar spherical collapse the detailed solution
structure is already known, but we also study more realistic situations
for which this is not the case. We analyse the behaviour of simulations
with varying numbers of particles (N) in order to identify the minimum N
for which the results are meaningful and stable. We find that the
adiabatic collapse and virialization of an isolated quasi-spherical
clump requires more than {\textasciitilde}100 gas particles in order to avoid
substantial spurious energy transfers between the gas and the dark
matter. Similar numbers are needed to obtain a qualitatively correct
description of the merging of clumps. With N\_gas\_ {\textgreater} 300, our
simulations converge to give results with only small residual systematic
deviations. However, in our experiments the gas always appears to gain
energy at the expense of the dark matter. This transfer has a physical
rather than a numerical origin. In a collision its magnitude increases
with the initial orbital energy, and it can produce significant
differences in the spatial distributions of gas and dark matter in the
resulting merger remnant, even if the initial distributions are
identical. Finally, we test the numerical reliability of several
approximate schemes for modelling additional physical processes that are
likely to play a key role in the evolution of the baryonic component of
galaxies, namely radiative cooling, star formation, and the injection of
energy by supernovae. In particular we study how the qualitative outcome
of an experiment is influenced by the detailed manner in which such
modelling is carried out. Unfortunately, we find a strong sensitivity to
some aspects of what can at best be a very crude representation of these

Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and
reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to
the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ˜1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

outside-in, starting in voids and gradually penetrating into overdense regions. Reionization should not be sudden but gradual, with a
continuous rise of the photon mean free path over a fair fraction of the Hubble time as the emissivity increases. We show that a hydrogen Gunn-Peterson trough should be present at z{\textasciitilde}=6 unless the emissivity increases with redshift at z{\textgreater}4. However, the epoch of overlap of cosmological H II regions could have occurred at a higher redshift if sources of low luminosity reionized the IGM; the Gunn-Peterson trough at z{\textasciitilde}6 would then appear because even the most underdense voids have a large enough neutral fraction in ionization equilibrium to be optically thick to Lyα photons. Cosmological H II regions near the epoch of overlap can produce gaps of transmitted flux only if luminous quasars contributed to the reionization, producing large H II regions. Despite the clumpiness of the matter distribution, recombinations do not increase the required emissivity of ionizing photons by a large factor during the reionization of hydrogen because the high-density gas is not ionized until a late time. We show that the He II reionization was most likely delayed relative to the hydrogen reionization but was probably complete by z{\textasciitilde}3 (the redshift where observations are available). The reported large optical depth fluctuations of He II are not necessarily due to an incomplete He II reionization but can arise from a combination of IGM density fluctuations and variations in the intensity of the He II ionizing background due to luminous QSOs.},

stochastic thermal, 'mechanical' (injecting energy or momentum depending
on the resolution), kinetic, and delayed cooling feedback. We focus on
the ability of each model to suppress star formation and generate
outflows. Our highest-resolution runs marginally resolve the adiabatic
phase of the feedback events, which correspond to 40 SN explosions, and
the first three models yield nearly identical results, possibly
indicating that kinetic and delayed cooling feedback converge to wrong
results. At lower resolution all models differ, with thermal dump
feedback becoming inefficient. Thermal dump, stochastic, and mechanical
feedback generate multiphase outflows with mass loading factors \${\textbackslash}beta
{\textbackslash}ll 1\$, which is much lower than observed. For the case of stochastic
feedback we compare to published SPH simulations, and find much lower
outflow rates. Kinetic feedback yields fast, hot outflows with
\${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}sim 1\$, but only if the wind is in effect hydrodynamically
decoupled from the disk by using a large bubble radius. Delayed cooling
generates cold, dense and slow winds with \${\textbackslash}beta{\textgreater} 1\$, but large
amounts of gas occupy regions of temperature-density space with short
cooling times. We conclude that either our resolution is too low to
warrant physically motivated models for SN feedback, that feedback
mechanisms other than SNe are important, or that other aspects of galaxy
evolution, such as star formation, require better treatment.},

We find good consistency with the observational measurements and the previous simulation work. By virtue of having several independent realizations for each set of numerical parameters, we are able to explore the effect of cosmic variance on observable quantities. One unexpected conclusion we are forced into is that cosmic variance is unusually large at z{\textgreater}6, with both our simulations and, most likely, observational measurements are still not fully converged for even such basic quantities as the average Gunn-Peterson optical depth or the volume-weighted neutral fraction. We also find that reionization has little effect on the early galaxies or on global cosmic star formation history, because galaxies whose gas content is affected by photoionization contain no molecular (i.e. star-forming) gas in the first place. In particular, measurements of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function by JWST are unlikely to provide a useful constraint on reionization.},

We also investigate the systematic uncertainty due to the lens modelling by using every available lens model individually and comparing the results; this systematic fractional uncertainty on alpha is {\textless}4\% at all

surveys allow us to place robust constraints on the low-mass-end slope
of the GSMFs, while the relatively large volume provides a better
constraint at higher masses compared to previous space-based studies.
Supplemented by a stacking analysis, we find a linear correlation
between the rest-frame UV absolute magnitude at 1500{\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm UV\}\$)
and logarithmic stellar mass (\${\textbackslash}log M\_*\$). We use simulations to
validate our method of measuring the slope of the \${\textbackslash}log M\_*\$-\$M\_\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}rm

technique combining photometry of individual bright galaxies with
stacked photometry for faint galaxies. The resultant measured slopes do
not significantly evolve over \$z=\$ 4-8, while the normalization of the

	abstract = {We carry out a new suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamic simulations that explores the relative impacts on reionization-epoch star formation of galactic outflows and photoionization heating from a self-consistently grown extragalactic ultraviolet ionizing background (EUVB). We compare the predictions with observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background, the ultraviolet continuum luminosity function of galaxies, and the Lyα forest. By itself, an EUVB
suppresses the luminosity function by less than 50\% at z = 6 even if it is orders of magnitude stronger than observed. This overproduces the observed galaxy abundance by a factor of 3-5, indicating the need for an additional feedback process. We confirm that outflows readily suppress both the EUVB and the luminosity function into improved agreement with observations. Population I-II star formation can reionize the universe by z = 6 even in the presence of strong feedback from photoheating and outflows. The resulting EUVB suppresses star formation in halos with virial temperatures below 105 K but has a weaker impact on more massive halos. Nonetheless, halos with virial temperatures below 105 K contribute up to {\textasciitilde}50\% of all ionizing photons owing to the EUVB's inhomogeneity. Overall, star formation rate scales with halo mass Mh as M 1.3-1.4 h for halos with Mh = 108.2-1010.2 M ⊙. This is a steeper dependence than is often assumed in reionization models, boosting the expected power spectrum of 21 centimeter
fluctuations on large scales. The luminosity function rises steeply to at least M 1600 = -13 even in models that treat both outflows and an EUVB, indicating that reionization was driven by faint galaxies (M 1600 {\textgreater}= -15) that have not yet been observed. Outflows and an EUVB interfere with each other's feedback effects in two ways. Outflows weaken the EUVB, limiting Jeans suppression of low-mass halos; this leads to overall de-amplification of suppression at early times (z {\textgreater} 8). Meanwhile, they amplify each other's impact on more massive halos, leading to overall amplification of suppression at later times. Our models cannot simultaneously explain observations of galaxies, the cosmic microwave background, and the intergalactic medium. Correcting for dynamic range limitations and adjusting our physical treatments will alleviate discrepancies, but observations may still require additional physical scalings such as a mass-dependent ionizing escape fraction.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4+-0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well.

Superbubbles from clustered young stars evolve quite differently to individual supernovae and are substantially more efficient at generating gas motions. The essential new components of the model are thermal conduction, subgrid evaporation and a subgrid multiphase treatment for cases where the simulation mass resolution is insufficient to model the early stages of the superbubble. The multiphase stage is short compared to superbubble lifetimes. Thermal conduction physically regulates the hot gas mass without requiring a free parameter. Accurately following the hot component naturally avoids overcooling. Prior approaches tend to heat too much mass, leaving the hot interstellar medium (ISM) below 106 K and susceptible to rapid cooling unless ad hoc fixes were used. The hot phase also allows feedback energy to correctly accumulate from multiple, clustered sources, including stellar winds and supernovae. We employ high-resolution simulations of a single star cluster to show the model is insensitive to numerical resolution, unresolved ISM structure and suppression of conduction by magnetic fields. We also simulate a Milky Way analogue and a dwarf galaxy. Both galaxies show regulated star formation and produce strong outflows.},

	abstract = {We develop a method for interpreting faint galaxy data which focuses on the integrated light radiated from the galaxy population as a whole. The emission history of the universe at ultraviolet, optical, and
near-infrared wavelengths is modeled from the present epoch to z {\textasciitilde} 4 by tracing the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy luminosity density, as determined from several deep spectroscopic samples and the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) imaging survey. In a q0 = 0.5,
h50 = 1 cosmology, the global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies can be well fitted by a simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent star formation rate (SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal initial mass function (IMF) extending from 0.1 to 125 M⊙. While a Salpeter IMF with a modest amount of dust reddening or a somewhat steeper mass function, φ(m) {\textasciitilde} m-2.7, can both reproduce the data reasonably well, a Scalo IMF produces too much long-wavelength light and is unable to match the observed mean galaxy colors. In the best-fit models, the global SFR rises sharply, by about an order of magnitude, from a redshift of zero to a peak value at z {\textasciitilde} 1.5 in the range 0.12-0.17 M⊙
yr-1 Mpc-3, to fall again at higher redshifts. After integrating the inferred star formation rate over cosmic time, we find a stellar mass density at the present epoch of
Ωsh250{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.005, hence a mean
stellar mass-to-light ratio {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}4 in the B-band and {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 in K,
consistent with the values observed in nearby galaxies of various morphological types. The models are able to account for the entire background light recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels probed by the HDF. Since only {\textasciitilde}20\% of the current stellar content of galaxies is produced at z {\textgreater} 2, a rather low cosmic metallicity is expected at these early times, in good agreement with the observed enrichment history of the damped Lyα systems. The biggest uncertainty is represented by the poorly constrained amount of starlight that was absorbed by dust and reradiated in the IR at early epochs. A ``monolithic collapse'' model, where half of the present-day stars formed at z {\textgreater} 2.5 and were shrouded by dust, can be made consistent with the global history of light, but overpredicts the metal mass density at high redshifts as sampled by quasi-stellar object absorbers.},

redshift (z {\textasciitilde} 7 to z {\textasciitilde} 4). β is measured using all ACS and WFC3/IR
passbands uncontaminated by Lyα and spectral breaks. Extensive
tests show that our β measurements are only subject to minimal
biases. Using a different selection procedure, Dunlop et al. recently
found large biases in their β measurements. To reconcile these
different results, we simulated both approaches and found that β
measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the same
passbands are used both to select the sources and to measure β.
High-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame UV color-magnitude
(CM) relationship that becomes systematically bluer toward fainter UV
luminosities. No evolution is seen in the slope of the UV CM
relationship in the first 1.5 Gyr, though there is a small evolution in
the zero point to redder colors from z {\textasciitilde} 7 to z {\textasciitilde} 4. This suggests that
galaxies are evolving along a well-defined sequence in the L
UV-color (β) plane (a "star-forming sequence"?). Dust
appears to be the principal factor driving changes in the UV color
β with luminosity. These new larger β samples lead to improved
dust extinction estimates at z {\textasciitilde} 4-7 and confirm that the extinction is
essentially zero at low luminosities and high redshifts. Inclusion of
the new dust extinction results leads to (1) excellent agreement between
the star formation rate (SFR) density at z {\textasciitilde} 4-8 and that inferred from
the stellar mass density; and (2) to higher specific star formation
rates (SSFRs) at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 4, suggesting that the SSFR may evolve modestly
(by factors of {\textasciitilde}2) from z {\textasciitilde} 4-7 to z {\textasciitilde} 2.

	abstract = {The 21 \{cm\} emission of neutral hydrogen is the most promising probe of
the epoch of reionization (EoR). In the next few years, the SKA
pathfinders will provide statistical measurements of this signal, such
as its power spectrum. Within one decade, SKA should produce a full
tomography of the signal. Numerical simulations predicting these
observations are necessary to optimize the design of the instruments and
help in the interpretation of the data. Simulations are reaching a
reasonable level in terms of scale range, but still often rely on
simplifications to compute the strength of the signal. The main
difficulty is the computation of the spin temperature of neutral
hydrogen which depends on the gas kinetic temperature and on the level
of the local Lyman-α flux (The Wouthuysen-Field effect). A
TS ≫ T\_CMB assumption is usual. However, this assumption
does not apply early in the reionization history, or even later in the
history as long as the sources of X-rays are too weak to heat the
intergalactic medium significantly. This work presents the first EoR
numerical simulations including, beside dynamics and ionizing continuum
radiative transfer, a self-consistent treatment of the Ly-α
radiative transfer. This allows us to compute the spin temperature more
accurately. We use two different box sizes, 20 h-1 \{Mpc\} and
100 h-1 \{Mpc\}, and a star source model. Using the redshift
dependence of average quantities, maps, and power spectra, we quantify
the effect of using different assumptions to compute the spin
temperature and the influence of the box size. The first effect comes
from allowing for a signal in absorption (i.e. not making the
TS ≫ T\_CMB approximation). The magnitude of this effect
depends on the amount of heating by hydrodynamic shocks and X-rays in
the intergalactic medium (IGM). With our source model we have little
heating so regions seen in absorption survive almost until the end of
reionization. The second effects comes from using the real, local,
Lyman-α flux. This effect is important for an average ionization
fraction of less than 10\%: it changes the overall amplitude of the 21
\{cm\} signal, and adds its own fluctuations to the power spectrum.},

	abstract = {Understanding the formation and evolution of the first stars and galaxies represents one of the most exciting frontiers in astronomy. Since the universe was filled with hydrogen atoms at early times, the most promising probe of the epoch of the first stars is the prominent 21-cm spectral line of hydrogen. Current observational efforts are focused on the cosmic reionization era, but observations of the pre-reionization cosmic dawn are also promising. While observationally unexplored, theoretical studies predict a rich variety of observational signatures from cosmic dawn. As the first stars formed, their radiation (plus that from stellar remnants) produced significant cosmic events including Lyman-alpha coupling at z{\textasciitilde}25, and early X-ray heating. Much focus has gone to studying the angle-averaged power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations. Additional probes include the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm spectrum, and the line-of-sight anisotropy of the 21-cm power spectrum. A particularly striking signature may result from the recently recognized effect of a supersonic relative velocity between the dark matter and gas. Work in this field, focused on understanding the whole era of reionization and cosmic dawn with analytical models and numerical simulations, is likely to grow in intensity and importance, as the theoretical predictions are finally expected to confront 21-cm observations in the coming years.

described. By using a tree threaded at all levels, tree traversals for
finding nearest neighbors are avoided. All operations on a tree
including tree modifications are O(N), where N is a number of cells, and
are performed in parallel. An efficient implementation of the tree is
described that requires 2N words of memory. A filtering algorithm for
removing high-frequency noise during mesh refinement is described. A FTT
can be used in various numerical applications. In this paper, it is
applied to the integration of the Euler equations of fluid dynamics. An
adaptive-mesh time stepping algorithm is described in which different
time steps are used at different levels of the tree. Time stepping and
mesh refinement are interleaved to avoid extensive buffer layers of fine
mesh which were otherwise required ahead of moving shocks. Test examples
are presented, and the FTT performance is evaluated. The
three-dimensional simulation of the interaction of a shock wave and a
spherical bubble is carried out that shows the development of azimuthal

	abstract = {We investigate phenomenological models of star formation and supernova
feedback in N -body/SPH simulations of galaxy formation. First, we
compare different prescriptions in the literature for turning cold gas
into stars neglecting feedback effects. We find that most prescriptions
give broadly similar results: the ratio of cold gas to stars in the
final galaxies is primarily controlled by the range of gas densities
where star formation is allowed to proceed efficiently. In the absence
of feedback, the fraction of gas that cools is much too high, resulting,
for example, in a K -band luminosity function that is much brighter than
observed. This problem is ameliorated by including a feedback model
which either imparts radial kinetic perturbations to galactic gas or
directly reheats such material and prevents it from cooling for a
certain period of time. In both these models, a significant fraction of
cold gas is heated and expelled from haloes with an efficiency that
varies inversely with halo circular velocity. Increasing the resolution
of a simulation allows a wider dynamic range in mass to be followed, but
the average properties of the resolved galaxy population remain largely
unaffected. However, as the resolution is increased, more and more gas
is reheated by small galaxies; our results suggest that convergence
requires the full mass range of galaxies to be resolved.},

of the assembly of galaxies driving the reionization of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) at z ≳ 6. The simulations account for
the hydrodynamical feedback from photoionization heating and the
explosion of massive stars as supernovae (SNe). Our reference
simulation, which was carried out in a box of size 25 h-1
comovingMpc using 2 × 5123 particles, produces a
reasonable reionization history and matches the observed UV luminosity
function of galaxies. Simulations with different box sizes and
resolutions are used to investigate numerical convergence, and
simulations in which either SNe or photoionization heating or both are
turned off, are used to investigate the role of feedback from star
formation. Ionizing radiation is treated using accurate radiative
transfer at the high spatially adaptive resolution at which the
hydrodynamics is carried out. SN feedback strongly reduces the star
formation rates (SFRs) over nearly the full mass range of simulated
galaxies and is required to yield SFRs in agreement with observations.
Photoheating helps to suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies, but
its impact on the cosmic SFR is small. Because the effect of
photoheating is masked by the strong SN feedback, it does not imprint a
signature on the UV galaxy luminosity function, although we note that
our resolution is insufficient to model star-forming minihaloes cooling
through molecular hydrogen transitions. Photoheating does provide a
strong positive feedback on reionization because it smooths density
fluctuations in the IGM, which lowers the IGM recombination rate
substantially. Our simulations demonstrate a tight non-linear coupling
of galaxy formation and reionization, motivating the need for the
accurate and simultaneous inclusion of photoheating and SN feedback in
models of the early Universe.},

helium; (2) the X-ray emission from the obscured and unobscured quasars
that gives origin to the X-ray background; (3) a piecewise

predicted H I and He II photoionization and photoheating rates for use,
e.g., in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of the Lyα forest
and a new metallicity-dependent calibration to the UV luminosity
density-star formation rate density relation. A "minimal cosmic
reionization model" is also presented in which the galaxy UV emissivity
traces recent determinations of the cosmic history of star formation,
the luminosity-weighted escape fraction of hydrogen-ionizing radiation
increases rapidly with look-back time, the clumping factor of the
high-redshift intergalactic medium evolves following the results of
hydrodynamic simulations, and Population III stars and miniquasars make
a negligible contribution to the metagalactic flux. The model provides a
good fit to the hydrogen-ionization rates inferred from flux decrement
and proximity effect measurements, predicts that cosmological H II (He
III) regions overlap at redshift 6.7 (2.8), and yields an optical depth
to Thomson scattering, τes = 0.084 that is in agreement
with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe results. Our new background

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4941},
	abstract = {We present an exact general remeshing scheme to compute exact integrals of polynomial functions over the intersections between convex polyhedral cells of old and new meshes. In physics applications this allows one to ensure global mass, momentum, and energy conservation while applying higher-order polynomial interpolation. We elaborate on applications of our algorithm arising in the analysis of cosmological N-body data, computer graphics, and continuum mechanics problems. A particular case we discuss most thoroughly is to remesh tetrahedral cells onto a Cartesian grid such that the volume integral over the domain of the polynomial function given on the input mesh is ensured to equal the equivalent volume integral over the output mesh. We refer to this as "physically conservative voxelization." At the core of our method is an algorithm for intersecting two convex polyhedra by successively clipping one against the faces of the other. This algorithm is an implementation of the ideas presented abstractly by Sugihara (1994), who suggests using the planar graph representations of convex polyhedra to ensure topological consistency of the output. This makes our implementation robust to geometric degeneracy in the input. We employ a simplicial decomposition to calculate moment integrals up to quadratic order over the resulting intersection domain. We also address practical issues arising in a software implementation, including numerical stability in geometric calculations, management of cancellations errors, and extension to two dimensions. In a comparison to recent work, we show substantial performance gains. We provide a C implementation intended to be a fast, accurate, and robust tool for geometrical calculations on polyhedral mesh elements.},

We find that the critical surface density for the existence of a cold interstellar phase depends only weakly on the parameters of the model and coincides with the empirically derived surface density threshold for star formation. Furthermore, it is shown that the drop in the thermal velocity dispersion associated with the transition from the warm to the cold gas phase triggers gravitational instability on a wide range of scales. The presence of strong turbulence does not undermine this conclusion if the disk is self-gravitating. Models based on the hypothesis that the onset of thermal instability determines the star formation threshold in the outer parts of galaxies can reproduce many observations, including the threshold radii, the column densities, and the sizes of stellar disks as a function of disk scale length and mass. Finally, prescriptions are given for implementing star formation thresholds in (semi-)analytic models and

We resolve \${\textbackslash}sim\$20,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within the virial radius of each host halo. Over the ranges set by our spatial resolution our convergence is excellent and improvements were made upon current state-of-the-art halo finders to better identify substructure at such high resolutions (e.g., on average we recover \${\textbackslash}sim\$4 subhalos in each host halo above 10\${\textasciicircum}8\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ which would have otherwise not been found using conventional methods). For our relaxed halos, the inner profiles are reasonably fit by Einasto profiles (\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ = 0.169 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.023) though this depends on the relaxed nature and assembly history of a given halo. Averaging over all halos, the substructure mass fraction is \$f\_\{m,subs\} = 0.121 {\textbackslash}pm 0.041\$, and mass function slope is d\$N\$/d\$M{\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{-1.88 {\textbackslash}pm 0.10\}\$ though we find scatter in the normalizations for fixed halo mass due to more concentrated hosts having less subhalos at fixed subhalo mass. There are no biases stemming from Lagrangian volume selection as all Lagrangian volume types are included in our sample. Our detailed contamination study of 264 low resolution halos has resulted in obtaining very large and unprecedented, high-resolution regions around our host halos for our target resolution (sphere of radius \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$1.4 {\textbackslash}pm 0.4\$ Mpc) allowing for accurate studies of low mass dwarf galaxies at large galactocentric radii and the very first stellar systems at high redshift (\$z {\textbackslash}geq\$ 10).},

Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. This suite of
hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations resolves formation of
star-forming giant molecular clouds to z = 0, and features an explicit
stellar feedback model on small scales. Our simulations reveal that
high-redshift galaxies undergo bursts of star formation followed by
powerful gusts of galactic outflows that eject much of the interstellar
medium and temporarily suppress star formation. At low redshift,
however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L* progenitors
develop stable discs and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of
star formation that does not drive outflows far into the halo.
Mass-loading factors for winds in L* progenitors are η ≈ 10 at
high redshift, but decrease to η ≪ 1 at low redshift. Although
lower values of η are expected as haloes grow in mass over time, we
show that the strong suppression of outflows with decreasing redshift
cannot be explained by mass evolution alone. Circumgalactic outflow
velocities are variable and broadly distributed, but typically range
between one and three times the circular velocity of the halo. Much of
the ejected material builds a reservoir of enriched gas within the
circumgalactic medium, some of which could be later recycled to fuel
further star formation. However, a fraction of the gas that leaves the
virial radius through galactic winds is never regained, causing most
haloes with mass Mh ≤ 1012 M⊙ to
be deficient in baryons compared to the cosmic mean by z = 0.},

	abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation
histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population
synthesis (SPS) techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations
from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries,
phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs)
to translate the evolution of a multimetallicity, multi-age set of stars
into a prediction for the time-evolution of the integrated light from
that set of stars. Each of these necessary inputs carries significant
uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention.
The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of
uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the
derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity
evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov
Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a
representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new
SPS model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including
uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z {\textasciitilde} 0 carry errors
of {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex at 95\% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color,
while at z {\textasciitilde} 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the
{\textasciitilde}0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current
observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize
the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating AGB phase. (3)
Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the
solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is
uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial
source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy
populations across time. Any possible evolution in the IMF, as suggested
by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this
problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a
galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield
important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a
concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some
of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral
libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet
been systematically investigated in the SPS context.},

	abstract = {Cosmological simulations make use of sub-grid recipes for the implementation of galactic winds driven by massive stars because direct injection of supernova energy in thermal form leads to strong radiative losses, rendering the feedback inefficient. We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a mismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the mass of the parent stellar population. Because too much mass is heated, the temperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic arguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical resolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected thermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose and test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum temperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both particle- and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark matter haloes with total mass 10{\textasciicircum}10 and 10{\textasciicircum}12 h{\textasciicircum}-1 solar masses. The thermal feedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive, large-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling temporarily. In accord with expectations derived from analytic arguments, for sufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposed temperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employing kinetic feedback.},

	abstract = {We discuss a numerical model for black hole growth and its associated feedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological simulations of structure formation to self-consistently follow the build up of the cosmic population of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our model assumes that seed black holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming haloes. We then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black holes in the course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we distinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole accretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be in a ‘quasar regime’, where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. The quasar activity requires high densities of relatively cold gas around the black hole, as it is achieved through large-scale inflows triggered by galaxy mergers. For black holes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback occurs in mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous environment. This regime of activity, which is subdominant in terms of total black hole mass growth, can be identified with radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies, and can suppress cluster cooling flows without the requirement of a triggering by mergers. Using our new model, we carry out treesph cosmological simulations on the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both for isolated systems and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model produces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad agreement with observational constraints. We find that the black holes significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing their star formation history, their amount of cold gas and their colours. Furthermore, the properties of intracluster gas are affected strongly by the presence of massive black holes in the cores of galaxy clusters, leading to shallower metallicity and entropy profiles, and to a suppression of strong cooling flows. Our results support the notion that AGNs are a key ingredient in cosmological structure formation. They lead to a self-regulated growth of black holes and bring the simulated properties of their host galaxies into much better agreement with observations.},

	abstract = {Context. Establishing the number of faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
at z = 4-6 is crucial to understanding their cosmological importance as
main contributors to the reionization of the Universe. Aims: In
order to derive the AGN contribution to the cosmological ionizing
emissivity we have selected faint AGN candidates at z{\textgreater} 4 in the
CANDELS GOODS-South field, which is one of the deepest fields with
extensive multiwavelength coverage from Chandra, HST, Spitzer, and
various ground-based telescopes. Methods: We have adopted a
relatively novel criterion. As a first step, high redshift galaxies are
selected in the NIR H band down to very faint levels (H ≤ 27) using
reliable photometric redshifts. At z{\textgreater} 4 this corresponds to a
selection criterion based on the galaxy rest-frame UV flux. AGN
candidates are then picked up from this parent sample if they show X-ray
fluxes above a threshold of FX ˜ 1.5 ×
10-17 erg cm-2 s-1 (0.5-2 keV),
corresponding to a probability of spurious detections of 2 ×
10-4 in the deep X-ray 4 Ms Chandra image. Results: We
have found 22 AGN candidates at z{\textgreater} 4 and we have derived the first
estimate of the UV luminosity function in the redshift interval 4
1450 ≲ -18.5 typical of local Seyfert galaxies. The
faint end of the derived luminosity function is about two to four
magnitudes fainter at z ˜ 4-6 than that derived from previous UV
surveys. We estimated ionizing emissivities and hydrogen photoionization
rates in the same redshift interval under reasonable assumptions and
after discussion of possible caveats, the most important being the large
uncertainties involved in the estimate of photometric redshift for
sources with featureless, almost power-law SEDs and/or low average
escape fraction of ionizing photons from the AGN host galaxies. Both
effects could, in principle, significantly reduce the estimated average
volume densities and/or ionizing emissivities, especially at the highest
redshifts. Conclusions: At z = 4-6.5 we argue that, under
reasonable evaluations of possible biases, the probed AGN population can
produce photoionization rates consistent with that required to keep the
intergalactic medium observed in the Lyman-α forest of high
redshift QSO spectra highly ionized, providing an important contribution
to the cosmic reionization.

fluctuations at very large scales. We systematically investigate the effects this additional power has on the progress, duration and features of reionization and on selected reionization observables. We find that comoving volume of ˜100 Mpc h-1 per side is sufficient for deriving a convergent mean reionization history, but that the reionization patchiness is significantly underestimated. We use
jackknife splitting to quantify the convergence of reionization
properties with simulation volume. We find that sub-volumes of
˜100 Mpc h-1 per side or larger yield convergent
reionization histories, except for the earliest times, but smaller volumes of ˜50 Mpc h-1 or less are not well converged at any redshift. Reionization history milestones show significant scatter between the sub-volumes, as high as Δz ˜ 1 for
˜50 Mpc h-1 volumes. If we only consider mean-density sub-regions the scatter decreases, but remains at Δz ˜
0.1-0.2 for the different size sub-volumes. Consequently, many potential reionization observables like 21-cm rms, 21-cm PDF skewness and kurtosis all show good convergence for volumes of ˜200 Mpc h-1, but retain considerable scatter for smaller volumes. In contrast, the three-dimensional 21-cm power spectra at large scales (k {\textless} 0.25 h Mpc-1) do not fully converge for any sub-volume size. These additional large-scale fluctuations significantly enhance the 21-cm fluctuations, which should improve the prospects of detection
considerably, given the lower foregrounds and greater interferometer sensitivity at higher frequencies.},

The goal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed to be non-radiative. We compare images of the cluster at \$z=0\$, global properties such as mass, and radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. The underlying gravitational framework can be aligned very accurately for all the codes allowing a detailed investigation of the differences that develop due to the various gas physics implementations employed. As expected, the mesh-based codes ART and AREPO form extended entropy cores in the gas with rising central gas temperatures. Those codes employing traditional SPH schemes show falling entropy profiles all the way into the very centre with correspondingly rising density profiles and central temperature inversions. We show that methods with modern SPH schemes that allow entropy mixing span the range between these two extremes and the latest SPH variants produce gas entropy profiles that are essentially indistinguishable from those obtained with grid based methods.},

	abstract = {The fraction of hydrogen ionizing photons escaping from galaxies into the intergalactic medium is a critical ingredient in the theory of reionization. We use two zoomed-in, high-resolution (4 pc), cosmological radiation hydrodynamic simulations with adaptive mesh refinement to investigate the impact of two physical mechanisms (supernova feedback and runaway OB stars) on the escape fraction (f\_esc) at the epoch of reionization (z{\textgreater}7). We implement a new, physically motivated supernova feedback model that can approximate the Sedov solutions at all (from the free expansion to snowplow) stages. We find that there is a significant time delay of about ten million years between the peak of star formation and that of escape fraction, due to the time required for the build-up and subsequent destruction of the star-forming cloud by supernova feedback. Consequently, the photon number-weighted mean escape fraction for dwarf galaxies in halos of mass 10{\textasciicircum}8-10{\textasciicircum}10.5 Msun is found to be {\textless}fesc{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}11\%, although instantaneous values of f\_esc{\textgreater}20\% are common when star formation is strongly modulated by the supernova explosions. We find that the inclusion of runaway OB stars increases the mean escape fraction by 22\% to {\textless}fesc{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}14\%. As supernovae resulting from runaway OB stars tend to occur in less dense environments, the feedback effect is enhanced and star formation is further suppressed in halos with Mvir{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun in the simulation with runaway OB stars compared with the model without them. While both our models produce enough ionizing photons to maintain a fully ionized universe at z{\textgreater}7 as observed, a still higher amount of ionizing photons at z{\textgreater}9 appears necessary to accommodate the high observed electron optical depth inferred from cosmic microwave background observations.},

We describe the physics behind these winds, discuss the observational evidence for them in nearby star-forming and active galaxies and in the high-redshift universe, and consider the implications of energetic winds for the formation and evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. To inspire future research, we conclude with a set of observational and theoretical challenges.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed description of a phenomenological H2 formation model and local star formation prescription based on the density of molecular (rather than total) gas. Such an approach allows us to avoid the arbitrary density and temperature thresholds typically used in star formation recipes in galaxy formation simulations. We present results of the model based on realistic cosmological simulations of high-z galaxy formation for a grid of numerical models with varied dust-to-gas ratios and interstellar far-UV (FUV) fluxes. Our results show that both the atomic-to-molecular transition on small,
tens-of-parsec scales and the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) relation on large, kiloparsec scales are sensitive to the dust-to-gas ratio and the FUV flux. The atomic-to-molecular transition as a function of gas density or column density has a large scatter but is rather sharp and shifts to higher densities with decreasing dust-to-gas ratio and/or increasing FUV flux. Consequently, star formation is concentrated to higher gas surface density regions, resulting in steeper slope and lower amplitude of the K-S relation at a given ΣH, in less dusty and/or higher FUV flux environments. We parameterize the dependences observed in our simulations in convenient fitting formulae, which can be used to model the dependence of the K-S relation on the dust-to-gas ratio and FUV flux in semi-analytic models and in cosmological simulations that do not include radiative transfer and H2 formation. Finally, we show that ionized gas can contribute a significant fraction of the total gas surface density in environments typical for high-redshift galaxies.},

We find that the brightness temperature fluctuation of the 21 cm signal has an amplitude greater than 100 mK during the early reionization, up to 10 times greater than the typical amplitude of a few 10 mK obtained during the later emission phase. More importantly, we find that even a rather high contribution from QSO-like sources only damps the absorption regime without erasing it. Heating the IGM with X-ray takes time. Our results show that observations of the early reionization will probably benefit from a higher signal-to-noise value than during later stages. After analyzing the statistical properties of the signal (power spectrum and PDF) we find three diagnostics to constrain the level of X-ray, hence the nature of the first sources.},

	abstract = {We have supplemented our code, which computes the evolution of the
physical state of a representative piece of the universe to include, not
only the dynamics of dark matter (with a standard PM code), and the
hydrodynamics of the gaseous component (including detailed collisional
and radiative processes), but also galaxy formation on a heuristic but
plausible basis. If, within a cell the gas is Jeans unstable,
collapsing, and cooling rapidly, it is transformed to galaxy subunits,
which are then followed with a collisionless code. These particles emit
UV radiation and supernova blasts with energy efficiencies (in units of
mc2) equal to (ɛUV,
ɛSN) = (10-4 , 10-4.5). This
energy input significantly alters some aspects of the simulation; the
primary consequences are to heat and ionize the gas at a much earlier
epoch than if stellar feedback were ignored. We study two representative
boxes with sizes L = (80, 8)h-1 Mpc, in both cases utilizing
a 2003 mesh containing 2003 dark matter particles and having
nominal resolutions of (400, 40)h-1 kpc, respectively, with
true resolution approximately 2.5 times worse. We adopt the standard CDM
perturbation spectrum with an amplitude of σ8 ≡
(δM/M)rms,8 = 0.77, a compromise between the COBE
normalization σ8 = 1.05 and that indicated by the
small-scale velocity dispersion (perhaps σ8 = 0.45).

We find that by the time that 0.2\% of the baryons have been transformed
to stars at redshift 8.6, reionization is ½ complete, and
observed Gunn-Peterson limits to a redshift of Ζ = 5 are satisfied.
Very hot (107 - 108 K) gas is produced by shocks
in the clusters, lower temperature (106 K) gas from
supernova-fed superwinds is in lower density filaments and sheets and
photo-heated gas (104-105 K) fills the voids. The
mass fractions in these components at redshift zero being roughly (29\%,
40\%, 31\%) correspond to gas in the temperature ranges
({\textless}105.5, 105.5-106.5,
{\textgreater}106.5) K.

In rich clusters the galaxy and dark matter densities are more
concentrated than the gas density in agreement with gravitational lens
observations. We can combine the observed and computed baryon to total
mass ratios with Ωb from light element nucleosynthesis,
and we conclude that we live in an open universe with
Ωtot = (0.11, 0.24) for h = (1.0, 0.5). While the
correspondence between the thermodynamic properties of gas and radiation
fields of this CDM model and the real world can be taken as support for
the former, it is likely that many of the attributes of this simulation
are generic, the result of a detailed physical treatment of atomic
processes, and will be found as well in rival cosmological models.},

due to spatial UV fluctuations in the post-overlap phase of reionization

the ionizing emissivity is dominated by large numbers of

significant contribution to the ionizing UV background by much rarer

Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic "dark ages" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z{\textasciitilde}1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than {\textasciitilde}1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves rms relative errors of the order of 10-4 for displacements and velocities in the refinement region and thus improves in terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude over previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at coarse-fine boundaries and do not suffer from
Fourier-space-induced interference ringing. An optional hybrid
multi-grid and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based scheme is introduced which has identical Fourier-space behaviour as traditional approaches. Using a suite of re-simulations of a galaxy cluster halo our
real-space-based approach is found to reproduce correlation functions, density profiles, key halo properties and subhalo abundances with per cent level accuracy. Finally, we generalize our approach for
two-component baryon and dark-matter simulations and demonstrate that the power spectrum evolution is in excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. For initial baryon density fields, it is suggested to use the local Lagrangian approximation in order to generate a density field for mesh-based codes that is consistent with the Lagrangian perturbation theory instead of the current practice of using the Eulerian linearly scaled densities.},

galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift, recent studies have proposed
models in which AGN contribute significantly to the z {\textgreater} 4 H I
ionizing background. In some models, AGN are even the chief sources of
reionization. If correct, these models would make necessary a complete
revision to the standard view that galaxies dominated the high-redshift
ionizing background. It has been suggested that AGN-dominated models can
better account for two recent observations that appear to be in conflict
with the standard view: (1) large opacity variations in the z {\textasciitilde} 5.5 H I
Lyman-alpha forest, and (2) slow evolution in the mean opacity of the He
II Lyman-alpha forest. Large spatial fluctuations in the ionizing
background from the brightness and rarity of AGN may account for the
former, while the earlier onset of He II reionization in these models
may account for the latter. Here we show that models in which AGN
emissions source {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 50 \% of the ionizing background generally provide
a better fit to the observed H I Lyman-alpha forest opacity variations
compared to standard galaxy-dominated models. However, we argue that
these AGN-dominated models are in tension with constraints on the
thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Under standard
assumptions about the spectra of AGN, we show that the earlier onset of
He II reionization heats up the IGM well above recent temperature
measurements. We further argue that the slower evolution of the mean
opacity of the He II Lyman-alpha forest relative to simulations may
reflect deficiencies in current simulations rather than favor
AGN-dominated models as has been suggested.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05655},
	abstract = {Feedback from supernovae is essential to understanding the self-regulation of star formation in galaxies. However, the efficacy of the process in a cosmological context remains unclear due to excessive radiative losses during the shock propagation. To better understand the impact of SN explosions on the evolution of galaxies, we perform a suite of high-resolution (12 pc), zoom-in cosmological simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy at z=3 with adaptive mesh refinement. We find that SN explosions can efficiently regulate star formation, leading to the stellar mass and metallicity consistent with the observed mass-metallicity relation and stellar mass-halo mass relation at z{\textasciitilde}3. This is achieved by making three important changes to the classical feedback scheme: i) the different phases of SN blast waves are modelled directly by injecting radial momentum expected at each stage, ii) the realistic time delay of SNe, commencing at as early as 3 Myr, is required to disperse very dense gas before a runaway collapse sets in at the galaxy centre via mergers of gas clumps, and iii) a non-uniform density distribution of the ISM is taken into account below the computational grid scale for the cell in which SN explodes. The last condition is motivated by the fact that our simulations still do not resolve the detailed structure of a turbulent ISM in which the fast outflows can propagate along low-density channels. The simulated galaxy with the SN feedback model shows strong outflows, which carry approximately ten times larger mass than star formation rate, as well as smoothly rising circular velocity. Other feedback models that do not meet the three conditions form too many stars, producing a peaked rotation curve. Our results suggest that understanding the structure of the turbulent ISM may be crucial to assess the role of SN and other feedback processes in galaxy formation theory. [abridged]},

We use analytic arguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical resolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected thermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose and test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum temperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both particle-based and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark matter haloes with total mass
1010 and 1012 h-1 M⊙. The thermal feedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive, large-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling temporarily. In accordance with expectations derived from analytic arguments, for sufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposed temperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employing kinetic feedback.},

budget of the Universe before reionisation was complete. There have been
a number of numerical studies trying to quantify their ionising
efficiency through the escape fraction fesc. While there is a clear
trend that fesc is higher for smaller haloes, there is a large scatter
in the distribution of fesc for a single halo mass. We propose that this
is due to the intrinsic burstiness of star formation in low mass
galaxies. We performed high resolution radiative hydrodynamics
simulations with ramsesrt to model the evolution of three galaxies and
their ionising efficiency. We found that the variability of fesc follows
that of the star formation rate. We then discuss the consequences of
this variability on the observability of such galaxies by JWST.},

The selection of z{\textasciitilde}4-8 galaxies over the five CANDELS fields allows us to assess the cosmic variance; the largest variations are apparent at z{\textgreater}=7. Our new LF determinations at z{\textasciitilde}4 and z{\textasciitilde}5 span a 6-mag baseline (-22.5 to -16 AB mag). These determinations agree well with previous estimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a more reliable sampling of {\textgreater}L* galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the UV LFs. Our new LF results strengthen our earlier findings to 3.4 sigma significance for a steeper faint-end slope to the UV LF at z{\textgreater}4, with alpha evolving from alpha=-1.64+/-0.04 at z{\textasciitilde}4 to alpha=-2.06+/-0.13 at z{\textasciitilde}7 (and alpha = -2.02+/-0.23 at z{\textasciitilde}8), consistent with that expected from the evolution of the halo mass function. With our improved constraints at the bright end, we find less evolution in the characteristic luminosity M* over the redshift range z{\textasciitilde}4 to z{\textasciitilde}7; the observed evolution in the LF is now largely represented by changes in phi*. No evidence for a non-Schechter-like form to the z{\textasciitilde}4-8 LFs is found. A simple conditional LF model based on halo growth and evolution in the M/L ratio of halos ((1+z)**-1.5) provides a good representation of the observed evolution.},

Using \$6300{\textasciicircum}3\$ gravitating particles in a cubic box of \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm box\} = 3150 {\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\$, we build a dense forest of halo merger trees to trace the halo merger history with a halo mass resolution scale down to \$M\_s = 2.7 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We build a set of particle and halo data, which can serve as testbeds for comparison of cosmological models and gravitational theories with observations. We find that the FoF halo mass function shows a substantial deviation from the universal form with tangible redshift evolution of amplitude and shape. At higher redshifts, the amplitude of the mass function is lower, and the functional form is shifted toward larger values of \${\textbackslash}ln (1/{\textbackslash}sigma)\$. We also find that the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature in the two-point correlation function of mock galaxies becomes broader with a peak position moving to smaller scales and the peak amplitude decreasing for increasing directional cosine \${\textbackslash}mu\$ compared to the linear predictions. From the halo merger trees built from halo data at 75 redshifts, we measure the half-mass epoch of halos and find that less massive halos tend to reach half of their current mass at higher redshifts.

We show that imposing periodic boundary conditions on the real-space correlator and choosing initial conditions by convolving a white noise random field results in a significantly smaller error than the traditional procedure of using the power spectrum. This convolution picture produces exact correlation functions out to separations of L/2, where L is the box size, which is the maximum theoretically allowed. This method also produces top-hat sphere fluctuations that are exact at radii R{\textless}=L/4. It is equivalent to windowing the power spectrum with the simulation volume before discretizing, thus bypassing sparse sampling problems. The mean density perturbation in the volume is no longer constrained to be zero, allowing one to assemble a large
simulation using a series of smaller ones. This is especially important for simulations of Lyα systems where small boxes with steep power spectra are routinely used.

We also present an extension of this procedure that generates exact initial conditions for hierarchical grids at negligible cost.},

emissivity at z ≳ 6 from the new Planck optical depth τ
measurements, from the constraints provided by quasar absorption spectra
and from the prevalence of Lyα emission in z ˜ 7-8
galaxies. We find the redshift evolution in the emissivity
\{{\textbackslash}dot\{N\}\}\{ion\}(z) required by the observations to be

CH ii and entirely independent of the nature of the ionizing

the evolution of the galaxy UV-luminosity density
(d\{\{log\}\}10\{ρ \}\{UV\}/\{dz\}=-0.11+/- 0.04) to a
magnitude limit ≳-13 mag, suggesting that galaxies are the
sources that drive the reionization of the universe. The role of
galaxies is further strengthened by the conversion from the UV
luminosity density ρUV to \{{\textbackslash}dot\{N\}\}\{ion\}(z)
being possible for physically plausible values of the escape fraction
fesc, the Lyman-continuum photon production efficiency
ξion, and faint-end cut-off Mlim to the
luminosity function. Quasars/active galactic nuclei appear to match
neither the redshift evolution nor normalization of the ionizing
emissivity. Based on the inferred evolution in the ionizing emissivity,
we estimate that the z ˜ 10 UV-Iuminosity density is
8-4+15× lower than at z ˜ 6,
consistent with the observations. The present approach of contrasting
the inferred evolution of the ionizing emissivity with that of the
galaxy UV luminosity density adds to the growing observational evidence
that faint, star-forming galaxies drive the reionization of the
universe.

The suite contains 48 Galaxy-size haloes, each within high-resolution volumes that span 2-5 Mpc in size, and each resolving thousands of systems with masses below the atomic cooling limit. Half of the ELVIS galaxy haloes are in paired
configurations similar to the Milky Way (MW) and M31; the other half are isolated, mass-matched analogues. We find no difference in the abundance or kinematics of substructure within the virial radii of isolated versus paired hosts. On Mpc scales, however, LG-like pairs average almost twice as many companions and the velocity field is kinematically hotter and more complex. We present a refined abundance matching relation between stellar mass and halo mass that reproduces the observed satellite stellar mass functions of the MW and M31 down to the regime where incompleteness is an issue, M* ˜ 5 ×
105 M⊙. Within a larger region spanning
approximately 3 Mpc, the same relation predicts that there should be ˜1000 galaxies with M* {\textgreater} 103
M⊙ awaiting discovery. We show that up to 50 per cent of haloes within 1 Mpc of the MW or M31 could be systems that have
previously been within the virial radius of either giant. By associating never accreted haloes with gas-rich dwarfs, we show that there are plausibly 50 undiscovered dwarf galaxies with H I masses
{\textgreater}105 M⊙ within the local volume. The radial velocity distribution of these predicted gas-rich dwarfs can be used to inform follow-up searches based on ultracompact high-velocity clouds found in the ALFALFA survey.},

medium (IGM) at the end of the reionization epoch using
moderate-resolution spectra of a sample of 19 quasars at
5.74em{\textless}6.42 discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. Three methods are used to trace IGM properties: (1) the
evolution of the Gunn-Peterson (GP) optical depth in the Lyα,
Lyβ, and Lyγ transitions; (2) the distribution of lengths of
dark absorption gaps; and (3) the size of H II regions around luminous
quasars. Using this large sample, we find that the evolution of the
ionization state of the IGM accelerated at z{\textgreater}5.7: the GP optical
depth evolution changes from
τeffGP{\textasciitilde}(1+z)4.3 to
(1+z){\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}11, and the average length of dark gaps with
τ{\textgreater}3.5 increases from {\textless}10 to {\textgreater}80 comoving Mpc. The
dispersion of IGM properties along different lines of sight also
increases rapidly, implying fluctuations by a factor of {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}4 in the UV
background at z{\textgreater}6, when the mean free path of UV photons is
comparable to the correlation length of the star-forming galaxies that
are thought to have caused reionization. The mean length of dark gaps
shows the most dramatic increase at z{\textasciitilde}6, as well as the largest
line-of-sight variations. We suggest using dark gap statistics as a
powerful probe of the ionization state of the IGM at yet higher
redshift. The sizes of H II regions around luminous quasars decrease
rapidly toward higher redshift, suggesting that the neutral fraction of
the IGM has increased by a factor of {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10 from z=5.7 to 6.4,
consistent with the value derived from the GP optical depth. The
mass-averaged neutral fraction is 1\%-4\% at z{\textasciitilde}6.2 based on the GP optical
depth and H II region size measurements. The observations suggest that
z{\textasciitilde}6 is the end of the overlapping stage of reionization and are
inconsistent with a mostly neutral IGM at z{\textasciitilde}6, as indicated by the
finite length of the dark absorption gaps.

We show that if recent claims of a numerous population of faint AGNs at z = 4-6 are upheld and the high inferred AGN
comoving emissivity at these epochs persists to higher, z ≳ 10,
redshifts, then active galaxies may drive the reionization of hydrogen and helium with little contribution from normal star-forming galaxies. We discuss an AGN-dominated scenario that satisfies a number of
observational constraints: the H i photoionization rate is relatively flat over the range 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 5, hydrogen gets fully reionized by z ≃ 5.7, and the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth is τ
≃ 0.056, in agreement with measurements based on the Lyα
opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and cosmic microwave
background polarization. It is a prediction of the model that helium gets doubly reionized before redshift 4, the heat input from helium reionization dominates the thermal balance of the IGM after hydrogen reionization, and z {\textgreater} 5 AGNs provide a significant fraction of the unresolved X-ray background at 2 keV. Singly and doubly ionized helium contribute about 13\% to τ, and the He iii volume fraction is already 50\% when hydrogen becomes fully reionized.},

Towards this goal, quasar absorption lines play a unique role by probing the properties of diffuse gas on galactic and intergalactic scales. In this review, we examine the multiple ways in which absorption lines trace the connection between galaxies and the intergalactic medium near the reionisation epoch. We first describe how the Ly α forest is used to determine the
intensity of the ionising ultraviolet background and the global ionising emissivity budget. Critically, these measurements reflect the escaping ionising radiation from all galaxies, including those too faint to detect directly. We then discuss insights from metal absorption lines into reionisation-era galaxies and their surroundings. Current
observations suggest a buildup of metals in the circumgalactic
environments of galaxies over z {\textasciitilde} 6 to 5, although changes in ionisation will also affect the evolution of metal line properties. A substantial fraction of metal absorbers at these redshifts may trace relatively low-mass galaxies. Finally, we review constraints from the Ly α
forest and quasar near zones on the timing of reionisation. Along with other probes of the high-redshift Universe, absorption line data are consistent with a relatively late end to reionisation (5.5 ≲ z
≲ 7); however, the constraints are still fairly week. Significant progress is expected to come through improved analysis techniques, increases in the number of known high-redshift quasars from optical and infrared sky surveys, large gains in sensitivity from next-generation observing facilities, and synergies with other probes of the
reionisation era.},

We show that if recent claims of a numerous population of faint AGNs at z = 4-6 are upheld and the high inferred AGN
comoving emissivity at these epochs persists to higher, z ≳ 10,
redshifts, then active galaxies may drive the reionization of hydrogen and helium with little contribution from normal star-forming galaxies. We discuss an AGN-dominated scenario that satisfies a number of
observational constraints: the H i photoionization rate is relatively flat over the range 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 5, hydrogen gets fully reionized by z ≃ 5.7, and the integrated Thomson scattering optical depth is τ
≃ 0.056, in agreement with measurements based on the Lyα
opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and cosmic microwave
background polarization. It is a prediction of the model that helium gets doubly reionized before redshift 4, the heat input from helium reionization dominates the thermal balance of the IGM after hydrogen reionization, and z {\textgreater} 5 AGNs provide a significant fraction of the unresolved X-ray background at 2 keV. Singly and doubly ionized helium contribute about 13\% to τ, and the He iii volume fraction is already 50\% when hydrogen becomes fully reionized.},

However, even in highly complex and dynamic environments the concept of the IGM remains reasonably well-defined; the largest ambiguity comes from the unvirialized regions around galaxies that are over-ionized by the local enhancement in the radiation field ("proximity zones"). That ambiguity precludes computing the IGM clumping factor to better than about 20{\textbackslash}\%.

	abstract = {The critical star formation rate (SFR) density required to keep the
intergalactic hydrogen ionized depends crucially on the average rate of
recombinations in the intergalactic medium (IGM). This rate is
proportional to the clumping factor C ≡
{\textless}ρ2b{\textgreater}IGM/{\textless}ρb{\textgreater}2,
where ρb and {\textless}ρb{\textgreater} are the local and
cosmic mean baryon density, respectively, and the brackets
{\textless}{\textgreater}IGM indicate spatial averaging over the recombining
gas in the IGM. We perform a suite of cosmological smoothed particle
hydrodynamic simulations that include radiative cooling to calculate the
volume-weighted clumping factor of the IGM at redshifts z {\textgreater}= 6. We
focus on the effect of photoionization heating by a uniform ultraviolet
background and find that photoheating strongly reduces the clumping
factor because the increased pressure support smoothes out small-scale
density fluctuations. Photoionization heating is often said to provide a
negative feedback on the re-ionization of the IGM because it suppresses
the cosmic SFR by boiling the gas out of low-mass haloes. However,
because of the reduction of the clumping factor it also makes it easier
to keep the IGM ionized. Photoheating therefore also provides a positive
feedback which, while known to exist, has received much less attention.
We demonstrate that this positive feedback is in fact very strong. Using
conservative assumptions, we find that if the IGM was reheated at z
{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 9, the observed population of star-forming galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 6 may
be sufficient to keep the IGM ionized, provided that the fraction of
ionizing photons that escape the star-forming regions to ionize the IGM
is larger than {\textasciitilde}0.2.},

	abstract = {Context: The hierarchical model of galaxy formation, despite its many successes, still overpredicts the baryons fraction locked in galaxies as a condensed phase. The efficiency of supernovae feedback, proposed a long time ago as a possible solution for this so-called
“overcooling” problem, is still under debate, mainly because
modelling supernovae explosions within a turbulent interstellar medium, while capturing realistic large scale flows around the galaxy is a very demanding task. Aims: Our goal is to study the effect of supernovae feedback on a disc galaxy, taking into account the impact of infalling gas on both the star formation history and the corresponding outflow structure, the apparition of a supernovae-driven wind being highly sensitive to the halo mass, the galaxy spin and the star
formation efficiency. Methods: We model our galaxies as cooling and collapsing NFW spheres. The dark matter component is modelled as a static external potential, while the baryon component is described by the Euler equations using the AMR code RAMSES. Metal-dependent cooling and supernovae-heating are also implemented using state-of-the-art recipes coming from cosmological simulations. We allow for three parameters to vary: the halo circular velocity, the spin parameter and the star formation efficiency. Results: We found that the ram pressure of infalling material is the key factor limiting the apparition of galactic winds. We obtain a very low feedback efficiency, with supernovae to wind energy conversion factor around one percent, so that only low circular velocity galaxies give rise to strong winds. For massive galaxies, we obtain a galactic fountain, for which we discuss the observational properties. Conclusions: We conclude that for quiescent isolated galaxies, galactic winds appear only in very low mass systems. Although this can quite efficiently enrich the IGM with metals, they do not carry away enough cold material to solve the overcooling problem.},

impede gas accretion and suppress star formation in the minihalo
progenitor, thus exerting a strong negative feedback on the initial
phase of galaxy assembly. The radiative feedback also leads to a
significant reduction in the central dark matter densities of the
minihalo. The properties of the galaxy become insensitive to the
inclusion of radiation once the minihalo turns into an atomic cooler.
The formation of a rotationally supported extended disk inside the
atomically cooling galaxy is therefore a robust outcome of our
simulations. Dwarf galaxies such as simulated here will be probed in

	abstract = {We investigate the importance of several numerical artefacts such as lack of resolution on spectral properties of the Lyalpha forest as computed from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in a standard cold dark matter universe. We use a new simulation code which is based on a combination of a hierarchical particle-particle-particle-mesh (P3M) scheme for gravity and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for gas dynamics. We have performed extensive comparisons between this new code and a modified version of the HYDRA code of Couchman et al. and find excellent agreement. We have also rerun the TREESPH simulations of Hernquist et al. using our new codes and find very good agreement with their published results. This shows that results from hydrodynamical simulations that include cooling are reproducible with different numerical algorithms. We then use our new code to investigate several numerical effects, such as resolution, on spectral statistics deduced from Voigt profile fitting of lines by running simulations with gas particle masses of 1.4x10{\textasciicircum}8, 1.8x10{\textasciicircum}7, 2.2x10{\textasciicircum}6 and 2.1x10{\textasciicircum}5Msolar. When we increase the numerical resolution the mean effective hydrogen optical depth converges and so does the column density distribution. However, higher resolution simulations produce narrower lines and consequently the b parameter (velocity width) distribution has only marginally converged in our highest resolution run. Obtaining numerical convergence for the mean HeII transmission is demanding. When progressively smaller haloes are resolved at better resolution, a larger fraction of
low-density gas contracts to moderate overdensities in which Heii is already optically thick, and this increases the net transmission, making it difficult to simulate Heii reliably. Our highest resolution
simulation gives a mean effective optical depth in Heii 5 per cent lower than the simulation with eight times lower mass resolution, illustrating the degree to which the Heii optical depth has converged. In contrast, the hydrogen mean optical depth for these runs is identical. As many properties of the simulated Lyalpha forest depend on resolution, one should be careful when deducing physical parameters from a comparison of the simulated forest with the observed one. We compare predictions from our highest resolution simulation in a cold dark matter universe, with a photoionizing background inferred from quasars as computed by Haardt \& Madau, with observations. The simulation reproduces both the HI column density and b parameter distribution when we assume a high baryon density, Omega\_Bh{\textasciicircum}2{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.028. In addition we need to impose a higher intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature than predicted within our basic set of assumptions. We argue that such a higher temperature could be caused by differences between the assumed and true reionization history. The simulated HI optical depth is in good agreement with observations, but the Heii optical depth is lower than observed. Fitting the Heii optical depth requires a larger jump, {\textasciitilde}14, between the photon flux at the HI and Heii edge than is present in the Haardt \& Madau spectrum.},

required to become more top heavy the lower the cluster metallicity and
the larger the pre-GC cloud-core density are. The deduced trends are in
qualitative agreement with theoretical expectation. The results are
consistent with estimates of the shape of the high-mass end of the IMF

the IMF independently constrained for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies

Here again, our analytical model predictions are in good agreement with simulation results, if one correctly takes finite resolution effect into account. We compare predictions of our analytical model to several observational constraints and conclude that a very narrow range of the model parameters is allowed. The important role played by galactic winds is outlined, as well as a possible "superwind" scenario in groups and clusters. The "anti-hierarchical" behavior of observed SFH is reproduced well by our best model with t\_*=3 Gyr and η\_w=1.5. We obtain in this case a present-day cosmic baryon budget of Ω*≃ 0.004, Ω\_cold≃ 0.0004,
Ωhot≃ 0.01 and Ω\_back ≃ 0.02 (diffuse

	abstract = {A set of cosmological variables, which we shall refer to as `supercomoving variables', are presented which are an alternative to the standard comoving variables, particularly useful for describing the gas dynamics of cosmic structure formation. For an ideal gas with a ratio of specific heats gamma=5/3, the supercomoving position, velocity and thermodynamic properties (i.e. density, temperature and pressure) of matter are constant in time in a uniform, isotropic, adiabatically expanding universe. Expressed in terms of these supercomoving variables, the non-relativistic, cosmological fluid conservation equations of the Newtonian approximation and the Poisson equation closely resemble their non-cosmological counterparts. This makes it possible to generalize non-cosmological results and techniques to address problems involving departures from uniform, adiabatic Hubble expansion in a straightforward way, for a wide range of cosmological models. These variables were initially introduced by Shandarin to describe structure formation in matter-dominated models. In this paper, we generalize supercomoving variables to models with a uniform contribution to the energy density corresponding to a non-zero cosmological constant, domain walls, cosmic strings, a non-clumping form of non-relativistic matter (e.g. massive neutrinos in the presence of primordial density fluctuations of small wavelength) or a radiation background. Each model is characterized by the value of the density parameter Omega\_0 of the non-relativistic matter component in which density fluctuation is possible, and the density parameter Omega\_X0 of the additional non-clumping component. For each type of non-clumping background, we identify families within which different values of Omega\_0 and Omega\_X0 lead to fluid equations and solutions in supercomoving variables which are independent of the cosmological parameters Omega\_0 and Omega\_X0. We also generalize the description to include the effects of non-adiabatic processes such as heating, radiative cooling, thermal conduction and viscosity, as well as magnetic fields in the MHD approximation. As an illustration, we describe three familiar cosmological problems in supercomoving
variables: the growth of linear density fluctuations, the non-linear collapse of a 1D plane-wave density fluctuation leading to pancake formation, and the well-known Zel'dovich approximation for extrapolating the linear growth of density fluctuations in three dimensions to the non-linear stage.},

suppression, for example, may explain the observed underabundance of
Local Group dwarfs relative to N-body predictions for Cold Dark Matter.
Reionization modelling requires simulating volumes large enough {\textasciitilde}(100
Mpc){\textasciicircum}3 to sample reionization "patchiness", while resolving millions of
galaxy sources above {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun, combining gravitational and gas
dynamics with radiative transfer. Modelling the Local Group requires
initial cosmological density fluctuations pre-selected to form the
well-known structures of the local universe today. Cosmic Dawn ("CoDa")
is the first such fully-coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of
reionization of the local universe. Our new hybrid CPU-GPU code,
RAMSES-CUDATON, performs hundreds of radiative transfer and ionization
rate-solver timesteps on the GPUs for each hydro-gravity timestep on the
CPUs. CoDa simulated (91 Mpc){\textasciicircum}3 with 4096{\textasciicircum}3 particles and cells, to
redshift 4.23, on ORNL supercomputer Titan, utilizing 8192 cores and
8192 GPUs. Global reionization ended slightly later than observed.
However, a simple temporal rescaling which brings the evolution of
ionized fraction into agreement with observations also reconciles
ionizing flux density, cosmic star formation history, CMB electron
scattering optical depth and galaxy UV luminosity function with their
observed values. Haloes below {\textasciitilde}3 x 10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun were severely affected by
the rising UV background: photoionization heating suppressed their star
formation. For most of reionization, star formation was dominated by
haloes between 10{\textasciicircum}10 - 10{\textasciicircum}11Msun. Intergalactic filaments display
sheathed structures, with hot envelopes surrounding cooler cores, but do
not self-shield, unlike regions denser than 100 rho\_average.},

cosmic reionization, in a simulation volume of (100h-1
Mpc)3. This is more than a two orders of magnitude
improvement over previous simulations. We achieve this by combining the
results from extremely large, cosmological, N-body simulations with a
new, fast and efficient code for 3D radiative transfer,
C2-RAY, which we have recently developed. These simulations
allow us to do the first numerical studies of the large-scale structure
of reionization which at the same time, and crucially, properly take
account of the dwarf galaxy ionizing sources which are primarily
responsible for reionization. In our realization, reionization starts
around z {\textasciitilde} 21, and final overlap occurs by z {\textasciitilde} 11. The resulting
electron-scattering optical depth is in good agreement with the
first-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) polarization
data. We show that reionization clearly proceeded in an inside-out
fashion, with the high-density regions being ionized earlier, on
average, than the voids. Ionization histories of smaller-size (5-10
comoving Mpc) subregions exabit a large scatter about the mean and do
not describe the global reionization history well. This is true even
when these subregions are at the mean density of the universe, which
shows that small-box simulations of reionization have little predictive
power for the evolution of the mean ionized fraction. The minimum
reliable volume size for such predictions is {\textasciitilde}30Mpc. We derive the power
spectra of the neutral, ionized and total gas density fields and show
that there is a significant boost of the density fluctuations in both
the neutral and the ionized components relative to the total at arcmin
and larger scales. We find two populations of HII regions according to
their size, numerous, mid-sized ({\textasciitilde}10-Mpc) regions and a few, rare, very
large regions tens of Mpc in size. Thus, local overlap on fairly large
scales of tens of Mpc is reached by z {\textasciitilde} 13, when our volume is only
about 50 per cent ionized, and well before the global overlap. We derive
the statistical distributions of the ionized fraction and ionized gas
density at various scales and for the first time show that both
distributions are clearly non-Gaussian. All these quantities are
critical for predicting and interpreting the observational signals from
reionization from a variety of observations like 21-cm emission,
Lyα emitter statistics, Gunn-Peterson optical depth and
small-scale cosmic microwave background secondary anisotropies due to
patchy reionization.},

absorption spectra that account for the contribution of galaxies and
QSOs to the ionising UV background. This improved models confirm our
earlier findings that a significant (\${\textbackslash}ge\$50\%) contribution of ionising

large scales. The inferred QSO luminosity function is thereby consistent
with recent estimates of the space density of QSOs at this redshift. Our

(110 comoving Mpc/h) high opacity absorption through observed in ULAS
J0148+0600, perhaps suggesting an even later end of reionization than
assumed in our previously favoured model. Medium-deep/medium area QSO
surveys as well as targeted searches for the predicted strong transverse
QSO proximity effect whould illuminate the origin of the observed large

We argue that Barnard 68 is currently experiencing a fatal collision with another small core which will lead to gravitational collapse. Despite the fact that this system is still in an early phase of interaction, our numerical simulations imply that the future gravitational collapse is already detectable in the outer surface density structure of the globule which mimics the profile of a gravitationally unstable Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Within the next 2 × 105 years, Barnard 68 will condense into a
low-mass solar-type star(s), formed in isolation, and surrounded by diffuse, hot interstellar gas.

new, physically motivated SN feedback model that can approximate the
Sedov solutions at all (from the free expansion to snowplow) stages. We
find that there is a significant time delay of about ten million years
between the peak of star formation and that of escape fraction, due to
the time required for the build-up and subsequent destruction of the
star-forming cloud by SN feedback. Consequently, the photon
number-weighted mean escape fraction for dwarf galaxies in halos of mass
108-1010.5 M ⊙ is found to be
{\textbackslash}langle\{f\_esc\}{\textbackslash}rangle{\textbackslash}sim 11\%, although instantaneous values of f
esc {\textgreater} 20\% are common when star formation is strongly
modulated by the SN explosions. We find that the inclusion of runaway OB
stars increases the mean escape fraction by 22\% to
{\textbackslash}langle\{f\_esc\}{\textbackslash}rangle{\textbackslash}sim 14\%. As SNe resulting from runaway OB stars
tend to occur in less dense environments, the feedback effect is
enhanced and star formation is further suppressed in halos with
\{\{M\}\_vir\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash},\{\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot \} in the simulation with runaway OB
stars compared with the model without them. While both our models
produce enough ionizing photons to maintain a fully ionized universe at
z {\textless}= 7 as observed, a still higher amount of ionizing photons at z
{\textgreater}= 9 appears necessary to accommodate the high observed electron
optical depth inferred from cosmic microwave background observations.},

densities, remains debated. Here, we study the physical origin of the star formation relations and breaks in several low-redshift galaxies, from dwarf irregulars to massive spirals. We use numerical simulations representative of the Milky Way and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds with parsec up to subparsec resolution, and which reproduce the observed star formation relations and the relative variations of the star formation thresholds. We analyze the role of interstellar
turbulence, gas cooling, and geometry in drawing these relations at 100 pc scale. We suggest in particular that the existence of a break in the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation could be linked to the transition from subsonic to supersonic turbulence and is independent of self-shielding effects. With this transition being connected to the gas thermal properties and thus to the metallicity, the break is shifted toward high surface densities in metal-poor galaxies, as observed in dwarf galaxies. Our results suggest that together with the collapse of clouds under self-gravity, turbulence (injected at galactic scale) can induce the compression of gas and regulate star formation.},

	abstract = {The hierarchical model of galaxy formation is known to suffer from the ``over-cooling'' problem: the high efficiency of radiative cooling results in too much baryonic matter in a condensed phase (namely, cold gas or stars) when compared to observations. A solution proposed by many authors (see Springel \& Hernquist 2003; Fujita et al. 2004; Rasera \& Teyssier 2005) is feedback due to supernova (SN) driven winds or active galactic nuclei. Modeling SN feedback by direct injection of thermal energy usually turns out to be inefficient in galaxy-scale simulations, due to the quasi-instantaneous radiation of the SN energy. To avoid this effect, we have developed a new method to incorporate SN feedback in cosmological simulations: using temporary test particles, we reproduce explicitly a local Sedov blast wave solution in the gas distribution. We have performed several self-consistent runs of isolated Navarro, Frenk, \& White (1996, hereafter NFW) halos with radiative cooling, star formation, SN feedback and metal enrichment using the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES (Teyssier 2002). We have explored the influence of SN feedback on the formation and the evolution of galaxies with different masses. We have studied the efficiency of the resulting galactic winds, as a function of the mass of the parent halo.},

	abstract = {What should these lectures be? The subject assigned to us is so broad that many books can be written about it. So, in planning these lectures I had several options. One would be to focus on a narrow subset of topics and to cover them in great detail. Such a subset necessarily would be highly personal and useful to a few read- ers at best. Another option would be to give a very shallow overview of the whole field, but then it won?t be very much different from a highly compressed version of a university course (which anyone can take if they wish so). So, I decided to be selfish and to prepare these lectures as if I was teaching my own graduate student. Given my research interests, I selected what the student would need to know to be able to discuss science with me and to work on joint research projects. So, the story presented below is both personal and incomplete, but it does cover several subjects that are poorly represented in the existing textbooks (if at all). Some of topics I focus on below are closely connected, others are disjoint, some are just side detours on specific technical questions. There is an overlapping theme, however. Our goal is to follow the cosmic gas from large scales, low densities, (rel- atively) simple physics to progressively smaller scales, higher densities, closer rela- tion to galaxies, and more complex and uncertain physics. So, we (you - the reader, and me - the author) are going to follow a "yellow brick road" from the gas well be- yond any galaxy confines to the actual sites of star formation and stellar feedback. On the way we will stop at some places for a tour and run without looking back through some others. So, the road will be uneven, but I hope that some readers find it useful.},

	abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega\_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n\_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68\% errors on measured parameters and 95\% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N\_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be {\textbar}Omega\_K{\textbar} {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

corresponds to a circular velocity of 25kms-1. This is significantly lower than the filtering mass obtained by the linear theory, which is often used in semi-analytical models of galaxy
formation. We demonstrate it is the gas temperature at the virial radius which determines whether a halo can accrete gas. A simple model that follows the merger history of the dark matter progenitors, and where gas accretion is not allowed when this temperature is higher than the virial temperature of the halo, reproduces the results from the simulation remarkably well.

	abstract = {We describe a new method for adding a prescribed amount of kinetic energy to simulated gas modeled on a cartesian grid by directly altering grid cells' mass and velocity in a distributed fashion. The method is explored in the context of supernova feedback in high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. In idealized tests at varying background densities and resolutions, we show convergence in behavior between models with different initial kinetic energy fractions at low densities and/or at high resolutions. We find that in high density media (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ 50 cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$) with coarse resolution (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim 4\$ pc per cell), results are sensitive to the initial fraction of kinetic energy due to the early rapid cooling of thermal energy. We describe and test a resolution dependent scheme for adjusting this fraction that approximately replicates our high-resolution tests. We apply the method to a prompt supernova feedback model, meant to mimic Type II supernovae, in a cosmological simulation of a \$10{\textasciicircum}9\$ Msun halo. We find that depositing small amounts of supernova energy in kinetic form (as little as 1\%) has a dramatic impact on the evolution of the system, resulting in an order of magnitude suppression of stellar mass. We discuss the distribution of stellar metallicities in the resulting system and find that while the mean metallicity is much more consistent with observations than in previous models, significant discrepancies remain that are likely due to our simplistic assumptions for the source of stellar feedback that neglect contributions from Type Ia supernovae and stellar winds.},

We incorporate a new method for including the radiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic simulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars, led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Population III stars to the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with
cosmological initial conditions in the standard ΛCDM model, with metallicities, from zero to 10-2 Zsolar, beginning at redshift z=99. The simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 × 105 Msolar dark matter halo, at z{\textasciitilde}18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core reveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z=0 and
10-4 Zsolar, contain one clump with 99\% of the mass, while the two with metallicities Z=10-3 and
10-2 Zsolar each contain two clumps that share most of the mass. The Z=10-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass protostellar objects with masses between 10-2 and 10-1 Msolar. Gas with
Z{\textgreater}=10-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the
temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which sets a lower limit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the
second-generation stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars but were still more massive, on average, than stars formed in the local universe.},

of the assembly of galaxies driving the reionization of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) at z ≳ 6. The simulations account for
the hydrodynamical feedback from photoionization heating and the
explosion of massive stars as supernovae (SNe). Our reference
simulation, which was carried out in a box of size 25 h-1
comovingMpc using 2 × 5123 particles, produces a
reasonable reionization history and matches the observed UV luminosity
function of galaxies. Simulations with different box sizes and
resolutions are used to investigate numerical convergence, and
simulations in which either SNe or photoionization heating or both are
turned off, are used to investigate the role of feedback from star
formation. Ionizing radiation is treated using accurate radiative
transfer at the high spatially adaptive resolution at which the
hydrodynamics is carried out. SN feedback strongly reduces the star
formation rates (SFRs) over nearly the full mass range of simulated
galaxies and is required to yield SFRs in agreement with observations.
Photoheating helps to suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies, but
its impact on the cosmic SFR is small. Because the effect of
photoheating is masked by the strong SN feedback, it does not imprint a
signature on the UV galaxy luminosity function, although we note that
our resolution is insufficient to model star-forming minihaloes cooling
through molecular hydrogen transitions. Photoheating does provide a
strong positive feedback on reionization because it smooths density
fluctuations in the IGM, which lowers the IGM recombination rate
substantially. Our simulations demonstrate a tight non-linear coupling
of galaxy formation and reionization, motivating the need for the
accurate and simultaneous inclusion of photoheating and SN feedback in
models of the early Universe.},

treatment of shocks, sound waves, supernovae explosions and collapsed haloes is a key condition for obtaining reliable validated simulations. We demonstrate that comparable results can be obtained for Lagrangian and Eulerian codes by requiring that approximately one particle exists per grid cell in the region of interest. We conclude that adaptive Eulerian codes, with their ability to place refinements in regions of rapidly changing density, are well suited to problems where physical processes are related to such changes. Lagrangian methods, on the other hand, are well suited to problems where large density contrasts occur and the physics are related to the local density itself rather than the local density gradient.},

The multigroup radiative transfer (RT) is performed on the AMR grid with a first-order Godunov method using the M1 closure for the Eddington tensor, and is coupled to the hydrodynamics via non-equilibrium thermochemistry of hydrogen and helium. This moment-based approach has the great advantage that the computational cost is independent of the number of radiative sources - it can even deal with continuous regions of emission such as bound-free emission from gas. As it is built directly into RAMSES, the RT takes natural advantage of the refinement and parallelization strategies already in place. Since we use an explicit advection solver for the radiative transport, the time-step is restricted by the speed of light - a severe limitation that can be alleviated using the so-called reduced speed of light approximation. We propose a rigorous framework to assess the validity of this approximation in various conditions encountered in cosmology and galaxy formation. We finally perform with our newly developed code a complete suite of RHD tests, comparing our results to other RHD codes. The tests demonstrate that our code performs very well and is ideally suited for exploring the effect of radiation on current scenarios of structure and galaxy formation.},

The usual reaction is to say that these tools are primarily intended for games since it is easy to imagine a player in a virtual environment and the added value to conventional 2D screens. Yet it is likely that there are many
applications in the professional field if these tools are becoming common. Introducing this technology into existing applications or new developments makes sense only if interest is properly evaluated. The use in Astronomy is clear for education, it is easy to imagine mobile and light planetariums or to reproduce poorly accessible environments (e.g., large instruments). In contrast, in the field of professional astronomy the use is probably less obvious and it requires to conduct studies to determine the most appropriate ones and to assess the contributions compared to the other display modes.},

relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with
galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be
reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy
lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and
the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we
find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation
function (CF) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement
with the observed clustering properties in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
at z = 0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional
strong constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can
therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute
the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of
galaxies with stellar masses in the range m ± dm/2 that reside in
a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the SHM relation
and show that, for low-mass halos, the SHM ratio is lower at higher
redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the stellar mass
dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that
not only are massive galaxies more biased than low-mass galaxies at all
redshifts, but also the bias increases more rapidly with increasing
redshift for massive galaxies than for low-mass ones. We present
convenient fitting functions for the SHM relation as a function of
redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of
stellar mass and redshift.},

	abstract = {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It
has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high
spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)
technique, with a tree-based data structure allowing recursive grid
refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar
to the one developed for the ART code {\textbackslash}citep\{kravtsov97\}, with minor
differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is
based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme
known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component.
The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test
cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific
refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and
potential spurious effects associated with shock waves propagation in
the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results
obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure
formation in a low density Lambda CDM universe are reported, with
2563 particles and 4.1x 107 cells in the AMR grid,
reaching a formal resolution of 81923. A convergence analysis
of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas
pressure power spectrum and individual haloe temperature profiles, shows
that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution
limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical
predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

describes the multiphase structure of star-forming gas on scales that
are typically not resolved in cosmological simulations. Our approach
includes radiative heating and cooling, the growth of cold clouds
embedded in an ambient hot medium, star formation in these clouds,
feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal heating and cloud
evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal enrichment.
Implemented using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, our scheme is a
significantly modified and extended version of the grid-based method of
Yepes et al., and enables us to achieve a high dynamic range in
simulations of structure formation.

We discuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it
predicts a self-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in
particular, stabilizes the star-forming gaseous layers of disc galaxies.
The parametrization of this mode can be reduced to a single free
quantity that determines the overall time-scale for star formation. We
fix this parameter numerically to match the observed rates of star
formation in local disc galaxies. When normalized in this manner,
cosmological simulations employing our model nevertheless overproduce
the observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated
to extend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with
star formation.

Using small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disc galaxies,
we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or outflows,
depending on the depth of the gravitational potential. In low-mass
haloes, winds can greatly suppress the overall efficiency of star
formation. When incorporated into cosmological simulations, our combined
model for star formation and winds predicts a cosmic star formation
density that is consistent with observations, provided that the winds
are sufficiently energetic. Moreover, outflows from galaxies in these
simulations drive chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium - in
principle, accounting for the presence of metals in the Lyman α
forest.},

In all clusters, gas-temperature profiles are measured to large radii (Vikhlinin et al.) so that direct hydrostatic mass estimates are possible to nearly r500 or beyond. The gas density was accurately traced to larger radii; its profile is not described well by a beta model, showing continuous steepening with radius. The derived ρtot profiles and their scaling with mass generally follow the Navarro-Frenk-White model with concentration expected for dark matter halos in ΛCDM cosmology. However, in three cool clusters, we detect a central mass component in excess of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, apparently associated with their cD galaxies. In the inner region (r {\textless} 0.1r500), the gas density and temperature profiles exhibit significant scatter and trends with mass, but they become nearly self-similar at larger radii. Correspondingly, we find that the slope of the mass-temperature relation for these relaxed clusters is in good agreement with the simple self-similar behavior, M500 Tα, where α = (1.5-1.6) ± 0.1, if the gas temperatures are measured excluding the central cool cores. The normalization of this M-T relation is significantly, by ≈30\%, higher than most previous X-ray determinations. We derive accurate gas mass fraction profiles, which show an increase with both radius and cluster mass. The enclosed fgas profiles within r2500 0.4r500 have not yet reached any asymptotic value and are still far (by a factor of 1.5-2) from the universal baryon fraction according to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. The fgas trends become weaker and its values closer to universal at larger radii, in particular, in spherical shells r2500 {\textless} r {\textless} r500.},

	abstract = {A simple, observationally motivated model is presented for understanding how halo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are related, and how these relations evolve with time. The relation between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance of galaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs, i.e., more massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. This "abundance matching" technique has been shown previously to reproduce the observed luminosity and scale dependence of galaxy clustering over a range of epochs. Halos at different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories
estimated from N-body simulations. The halo-galaxy connection at fixed epochs in conjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connection between observed galaxies across time. With approximations for the impact of merging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly infer the star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass. This model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellar mass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass relation to z {\textasciitilde} 1. The data demands, for example, that the star
formation rate density is dominated by galaxies with M star ≈ 1010.0-10.5 M sun from 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1, and
that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos with M
vir ≈ 1011.5-12.5 M sun. The
SFR-halo mass relation is approximately Gaussian over the range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 with a mildly evolving mean and normalization. This model is then used to shed light on a number of issues, including (1) a clarification of "downsizing", (2) the lack of a sharp characteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and (3) the dominance of star formation over merging to the stellar buildup of galaxies with M star lsim 1011 M sun at z {\textless} 1.},

	abstract = {We measure the star formation efficiency (SFE), the star formation rate (SFR) per unit of gas, in 23 nearby galaxies and compare it with expectations from proposed star formation laws and thresholds. We use H I maps from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and derive H 2 maps of CO measured by HERA CO-Line Extragalactic Survey and Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies. We estimate the SFR by combining Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) far-ultraviolet maps and the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) 24 μm maps, infer stellar surface density profiles from SINGS 3.6 μm data, and use kinematics from THINGS. We measure the SFE as a function of the free fall and orbital timescales, midplane gas pressure, stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the effects of stars), the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear, and the ability of a cold phase to form. In spirals, the SFE of H 2 alone is nearly constant at (5.25 ± 2.5) × 10 –10 yr –1 (equivalent to an H 2 depletion time of 1.9 × 10 9 yr) as a function of all of these variables at our 800 pc resolution. Where the interstellar medium (ISM) is mostly H I , however, the SFE decreases with increasing radius in both spiral and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably described by an exponential with scale length 0.2 r 25 -0.25 r 25 . We interpret this decline as a strong dependence of giant molecular cloud (GMC) formation on environment. The ratio of molecular-to-atomic gas appears to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and pressure spanning from the H 2 -dominated to H I -dominated ISM. The radial decline in SFE is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in the free-fall time or orbital time. Thresholds for large-scale instability suggest that our disks are stable or marginally stable and do not show a clear link to the declining SFE. We suggest that ISM physics below the scales that we observe—phase balance in the H I , H 2 formation and destruction, and stellar feedback—governs the formation of GMCs from H I .},

simulations with 20483 dark matter particles,
20483 gas cells, and 17 billion adaptive rays in a L = 100
Mpc h -1 box, we show that the density and reionization
redshift fields are highly correlated on large scales (gsim 1 Mpc h
-1). This correlation can be statistically represented
by a scale-dependent linear bias. We construct a parametric function for
the bias, which is then used to filter any large-scale density field to
derive the corresponding spatially varying reionization redshift field.
The parametric model has three free parameters that can be reduced to
one free parameter when we fit the two bias parameters to simulation
results. We can differentiate degenerate combinations of the bias
parameters by combining results for the global ionization histories and
correlation length between ionized regions. Unlike previous
semi-analytic models, the evolution of the reionization redshift field
in our model is directly compared cell by cell against simulations and
performs well in all tests. Our model maps the high-resolution,
intermediate-volume radiation-hydrodynamic simulations onto
lower-resolution, larger-volume N-body simulations (gsim 2 Gpc h

cosmological simulations is currently hampered by a lack of numerical resolution. We present and test a subgrid recipe to model feedback from massive stars in cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulations. The energy is distributed in kinetic form among the gas particles surrounding recently formed stars. The impact of the feedback is studied using a suite of high-resolution simulations of isolated disc galaxies embedded in dark haloes with total mass 1010 and 1012h-1Msolar. We focus, in particular, on the effect of pressure forces on wind particles within the disc, which we turn off temporarily in some of our runs to mimic a recipe that has been widely used in the literature. We find that this popular recipe gives dramatically different results because (ram) pressure forces on expanding superbubbles determine both the structure of the disc and the development of large-scale outflows. Pressure forces exerted by
expanding superbubbles puff up the disc, giving the dwarf galaxy an irregular morphology and creating a galactic fountain in the massive galaxy. Hydrodynamic drag within the disc results in a strong increase in the effective mass loading of the wind for the dwarf galaxy, but quenches much of the outflow in the case of the high-mass galaxy.},

	abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code gadget-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the ‘tree’ method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. gadget-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

followed self-consistently with gas and dark matter dynamics using the
RAMSES code, while radiative transfer is performed as a post-processing
step using a moment-based method with the M1 closure relation in the
ATON code. The latter has been ported to a multiple Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) architecture using the CUDA language together with the MPI
library, resulting in an overall acceleration that allows us to tackle
radiative transfer problems at a significantly higher resolution than
previously reported: 10243 + 2 levels of refinement for the
hydrodynamic adaptive grid and 10243 for the radiative
transfer Cartesian grid. We reach a typical acceleration factor close to
100× when compared to the CPU version, allowing us to perform 1/4
million time steps in less than 3000 GPU hr. We observe good convergence
properties between our different resolution runs for various volume- and
mass-averaged quantities such as neutral fraction, UV background, and
Thomson optical depth, as long as the effects of finite resolution on
the star formation history are properly taken into account. We also show
that the neutral fraction depends on the total mass density, in a way
close to the predictions of photoionization equilibrium, as long as the
effect of self-shielding are included in the background radiation model.
Although our simulation suite has reached unprecedented mass and spatial
resolution, we still fail in reproducing the z {\textasciitilde} 6 constraints on the
neutral fraction of hydrogen and the intensity of the UV background. In
order to account for unresolved density fluctuations, we have modified
our chemistry solver with a simple clumping factor model. Using our most
spatially resolved simulation (12.5 Mpc h -1 with
10243 particles) to calibrate our subgrid model, we have
resimulated our largest box (100 Mpc h -1 with
10243 particles) with the modified chemistry, successfully
reproducing the observed level of neutral hydrogen in the spectra of
high-redshift quasars. We however did not reproduce the average
photoionization rate inferred from the same observations. We argue that
this discrepancy could be partly explained by the fact that the average
radiation intensity and the average neutral fraction depend on different
regions of the gas density distribution, so that one quantity cannot be
simply deduced from the other.},

star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675
Ks -selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. The
SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous
measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was
only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z {\textasciitilde} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5,
respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall
growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as
ρstarvprop(1 + z)-4.7 ± 0.4 since
z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as
ρstarvprop(1 + z)-2.3 ± 0.2. At z
{\textgreater} 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar
masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to
z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks -selected star-forming galaxy
SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 show reasonable
agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the
majority of the stellar mass density at z {\textgreater} 3.5. We estimate the
average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at
fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(M
star/M ⊙) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in
mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with
log(M star/M ⊙) = 10.5 have grown by {\textgreater}1.0
dex since z = 2. At z {\textless} 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth
are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the
mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and
primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic
uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates,
stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent
galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.

	abstract = {Star formation laws are rules that relate the rate of star formation in
a particular region, either an entire galaxy or some portion of it, to
the properties of the gas, or other galactic properties, in that region.
While observations of Local Group galaxies show a very simple, local
star formation law in which the star formation rate per unit area in
each patch of a galaxy scales linearly with the molecular gas surface
density in that patch, recent observations of both Milky Way molecular
clouds and high-redshift galaxies apparently show a more complicated
relationship in which regions of equal molecular gas surface density can
form stars at quite different rates. These data have been interpreted as
implying either that different star formation laws may apply in
different circumstances, that the star formation law is sensitive to
large-scale galaxy properties rather than local properties, or that
there are high-density thresholds for star formation. Here we collate
observations of the relationship between gas and star formation rate
from resolved observations of Milky Way molecular clouds, from kpc-scale
observations of Local Group galaxies, and from unresolved observations
of both disk and starburst galaxies in the local universe and at high
redshift. We show that all of these data are in fact consistent with a
simple, local, volumetric star formation law. The apparent variations
stem from the fact that the observed objects have a wide variety of
three-dimensional size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even
at fixed gas column density the regions being observed can have wildly
varying volume densities. We provide a simple theoretical framework to
remove this projection effect, and we use it to show that all the data,
from small solar neighborhood clouds with masses {\textasciitilde}103 M
⊙ to submillimeter galaxies with masses
{\textasciitilde}1011 M ⊙, fall on a single star formation
law in which the star formation rate is simply {\textasciitilde}1\% of the molecular gas
mass per local free-fall time. In contrast, proposed star formation laws
in which the star formation timescale is set by the galactic rotation
period are inconsistent with the data from the Milky Way and the Local
Group, while those in which the star formation rate is linearly
proportional to the gas mass above some density threshold fail both in
the Local Group and for starburst galaxies.},

In this study, I present results of self-consistent cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxy formation that
reproduce the Schmidt law naturally, without assuming it, and provide some clues to this puzzle. The simulations have a dynamic range high enough to identify individual star-forming regions. The results indicate that the global Schmidt law is a manifestation of the overall density distribution of the interstellar medium. In particular, the density probability distribution function (PDF) in the simulated disks has a well-defined generic shape that can be approximated by a lognormal distribution at high densities. The PDF in a given region of the disk depends on the local average surface density Σg. The
dependence is such that the fraction of gas mass in the high-density tail of the distribution scales as Σn-1g
with n{\textasciitilde}1.4, which gives rise to the Schmidt-like correlation. The high-density tail of the PDF is remarkably insensitive to the inclusion of feedback and details of the cooling and heating processes. This indicates that the global star formation rate is determined by the supersonic turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities on large scales, rather than stellar feedback or thermal instabilities on small scales.},

populations, suggest that reionization is a process that begins as early as z 14, and ends with the "percolation" phase at z 6 to 8. Low

  abstract={This paper presents the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), a 1 million s exposure of an 11 arcmin 2 region in the southern sky with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope using Director's Discretionary Time. The exposure time was divided among four filters, F435W ( B 435 ), F606W ( V 606 ), F775W ( i 775 ), and F850LP ( z 850 ), to give approximately uniform limiting magnitudes m AB ~ 29 for point sources. The image contains at least 10,000 objects, presented here as a catalog, the vast majority of which are galaxies. Visual inspection of the images shows few if any galaxies at redshifts greater than ~4 that resemble present-day spiral or elliptical galaxies. The image reinforces the conclusion from the original Hubble Deep Field that galaxies evolved strongly during the first few billion years in the infancy of the universe. Using the Lyman break dropout method to derive samples of galaxies at redshifts between 4 and 7, it is possible to study the apparent evolution of the galaxy luminosity function and number density. Examination of the catalog for dropout sources yields 504 B 435 dropouts, 204 V 606 dropouts, and 54 i 775 dropouts. The i 775 dropouts are most likely galaxies at redshifts between 6 and 7. Using these samples, which are at different redshifts but derived from the same data, we find no evidence for a change in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies but some evidence for a decrease in their number densities between redshifts of 4 and 7. Assessing the factors needed to derive the luminosity function from the data suggests that there is considerable uncertainty in parameters from samples discovered with different instruments and derived using independent assumptions about the source populations. This assessment calls into question some of the strong conclusions of recently published work on distant galaxies. The ultraviolet luminosity density of these samples is dominated by galaxies fainter than the characteristic luminosity, and the HUDF reveals considerably more luminosity than shallower surveys. The apparent ultraviolet luminosity density of galaxies appears to decrease from redshifts of a few to redshifts greater than 6, although this decrease may be the result of faint-end incompleteness in the most distant samples. The highest redshift samples show that star formation was already vigorous at the earliest epochs at which galaxies have been observed, less than 1 billion years after the big bang.}

The author presents a derivation of a relation between the two for which a new approach to the diffusion approximation is used. Algebraic expressions for Eddington factors satisfying the moment conditions are not satisfactory for closing the P-1 equations but, by using the derived relation, yield acceptable flux-limited diffusion theories.},

	abstract = {A radiative transfer scheme is presented, based on a moment description
of the equation of radiative transfer and the so-called `M1 closure
model' for the Eddington tensor. This model features a strictly
hyperbolic transport step for radiation: it has been implemented using
standard Godunov-like techniques in a new code called ATON. Coupled to
simple models of ionization chemistry and photoheating, ATON is able to
reproduce the results of other schemes on a various set of standard
tests such as the expansion of a HII region, the shielding of the
radiation by dense clumps and cosmological ionization by multiple
sources. Being simple yet robust, such a scheme is intended to be
naturally and easily included in grid-based cosmological fluid solvers.},

transfer based on the Optically Thin Variable Eddington Tensor (OTVET)
approximation. Our method insures the exact conservation of the photon
number and flux (in the explicit formulation) and automatically switches
from the optically thick to the optically thin regime. It scales as N
log N with the number of hydrodynamic resolution elements and is
independent of the number of sources of ionizing radiation (i.e. works
equally fast for an arbitrary source function). We also describe an
implementation of the algorithm in a Soften Lagrangian Hydrodynamic code
(SLH) and a multi-frequency approach appropriate for hydrogen and helium
continuum opacities. We present extensive tests of our method for single
and multiple sources in homogeneous and inhomogeneous density
distributions, as well as a realistic simulation of cosmological
reionization.},
